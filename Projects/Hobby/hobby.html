    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in San Franscisco, I have been hiking for my entire life. Most of my summers consisted of going to the Sierra Nevadas and Camping with family and friends. To this day, at the age of 40, I enjoy getting outdoors to hike, camp, fish and swim. I work wiht a non-profit called Latino Outdoors, we get POC's into outdoors public spaces. </br>
        Here is an article that I was featured in for plus size gear for the outdoors.</p>
