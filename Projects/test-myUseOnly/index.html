                    Here is an article that I was featured in for plus size gear for the outdoors. I have enjoyed Hiking because it allows me the time to think about things in my life, recconect with nature and with my family. I am able to slow down and focus on the trail. Seeing what is around in terms of flora and fauna is real importat to me. At time I like to capture my hikes with photos or writw down my thoughts in a journal.</p>
