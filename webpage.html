    <h3>Memories of Childhood</h3>
     <p>These are random lines of code and my thoughts, not much to say. <br>
         I can continue to write out code and figure out next steps.<br>
        Wondering how to keep my code cleaner and have more comments for <br>
        future uses especailly when getting into functions.
